welcome to github auto checking by Temo,
i have 2 version of github auto check algorithm 


what's different between both version:

Version 1:
in version 1 its doesnt ignore node_modules 

Version 2:
in version 2 it ignores nodue_modules

in the second folder "Goa-Homeworks" delete it and clone your github repository and name it in both version in last line of code
